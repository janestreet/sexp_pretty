(** Pretty-printing of S-expressions.

    Warning!  It is not recommended to use this library in critical code, and certainly
    not in a context where the sexp produced by that module are expected to be parsed
    again.  There is no guarantee that the code won't raise.  The scrutiny of review is
    low at the moment and some work would be required to bump it.  Suitable for human
    readable sexps only.  It was added to the base projection to allow expect tests to
    more easily generate more readable s-expressions, even when used in contexts that
    require base-projection only code. *)
